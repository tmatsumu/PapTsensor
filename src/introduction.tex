\section{Introduction}
This is git commit test from Yuki Sakurai.
\begin{itemize}
\item Temperature monitoring at cryogenic temperature
\item remote sensing
\item bolometer or some other methods
\item SMB is a good tool to achieve the continuous motion at the cryogenic temperature
\item motivation, we want to know the rotor temperature when it is spinning
\item We demonstrate the remote sensing temperature measurement method using temperature dependence of the magnetisation
\item each chapter describe what
\end{itemize}
