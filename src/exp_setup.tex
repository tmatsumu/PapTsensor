\section{Experimental setup}

Fig. X shows cross section view of experimental setup of the SMB,
which is mainly constructed with a rotor, a stator and a rotor gripper.
The rotor is a NdFeB Permanent Magnet ring (PM) with 1.1 Tesla remnants,
inserted into aluminum frame.
The stator is YBCO superconductor right type array with critical temperature of more than 90K,
refrred to as a High Temperature Superconducting (HTS).
The rotor gripper

\begin{itemize}
\item inside including the SMB
\item hall sensor and temperature sensor
\item temperature sensor accuracy
\item DAQ
\end{itemize}
