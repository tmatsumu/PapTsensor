Fig. X shows cross section view of SMB experimental setup,
which is mainly constructed with a rotor, a stator and a rotor holding system.
The rotor is a NdFeB Permanent Magnet ring (PM) with 1.1 Tesla remnants,
inserted into aluminum frame.
The stator is a YBCO superconductor ring type array with critical temperature of more than 90K,
refrred to as a High Temperature Superconducting (HTS).
As the holding system, three holder arms with cryogenic stepping motors are mounted
to hold the rotor in place above the critical temperature of the HTS.
